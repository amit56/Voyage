Starter code from amit and dora's menger sponge, but this is only amit's final project

To run: Simply do "./run.sh"  You may need to update the cmake folder to contain the
correct locations of glew and glfw for your own computer.

Controls: The controls are the same as they were for menger sponge milestone 2, with the following modifications:

To rotate the boat: J and L

Move boat forward: I

Move boat backward: K

FPS mode on/off: C

Additive Blending for Over-Water Caustics on/off: B

Default view (third person): Q (must turn FPS mode off before tapping Q)
So to go to default view, press Q.  And if that doesn't work, then you are still
in fps mode, so press C and then Q.

Pictures:  All pictures are in the pictures folder, with descriptive names

Report: the report can be found in the report.pdf folder.

ecis survey: I filled out the ecis survey for this class
