basically:
	1) vertex shader, do the rigid transformation of rotate and translate
	2) geometric shader, change the normal of the face based off of this transformation
	3) fragment shader, basically colors the actual shit, then divide by z and drop the z access and multiply by the projection matrix (or maybe open glm does the drop the z and divide by z for us)
